I created this website as an incentive to write more. Also, I hope this website will be a place for me to record my growth journey. The main topics of the site include economics and data science (mostly regression and machine learning).
I might occasionally feature personal stories such as learning, traveling, Vietnam, and Hong Kong.
The name of the website is inspired by Duong Pham, who played the “wheel of names” with me. On one hand, the website just means my name - Dung N. On the other hand, its name means Dung n Site, which is a spoonerism for right and wrong…
Thanks for visiting and I hope you will enjoy it!
