Welcome to my page, my name is Dung (Shayne) Nguyen. I am an economics graduate from The University of Hong Kong. My main interests are political economy, development economics and quantitative methods. I also create this website to record my growth journey. Thus, I might occasionally feature personal stories such as learning, traveling, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. 

Thanks for visiting and I hope you will enjoy it!
