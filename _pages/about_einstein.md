Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I created this website as an incentive to write more. Also, I hope this website will be a place for me to record my growth journey. The main topics of the site include economics and data science (mostly regression and machine learning).
I might occasionally feature personal stories such as learning, traveling, Vietnam, and Hong Kong.
The name of the website is inspired by Duong Pham, who played the “wheel of names” with me. On one hand, the website just means my name - Dung N. On the other hand, its name means Dung n Site, which is a spoonerism for right and wrong…
Thanks for visiting and I hope you will enjoy it!
